*A #text(fill: red)[Memorable] Trip to Beijing*

Dear teacher and classmates,

I am excited to share with you my #text(fill: red)[unforgettable] journey to Beijing during the summer vacation.

We set off by car, and #text(fill: red)[along the way] I #text(fill: red)[admired] the endless green trees and colorful flowers on both sides of the road. By the time we arrived, it was already evening. After #text(fill: red)[enjoying] a delicious hot pot, we #text(fill: red)[checked into] a comfortable hotel and#text(fill: red)[ prepared for the days ahead].

The next morning, #text(fill: red)[the golden sun rose over the city, filling the streets with warmth and energy]. We visited Beihai Park, where the lake #text(fill: red)[sparkled under the sunlight] and we took many beautiful photos. Later, we #text(fill: red)[tasted] the famous Beijing roast duck. Its crispy skin and tender meat #text(fill: red)[left a deep impression on me].

In the evening, we went to the park to relax. My parents jogged together #text(fill: red)[while] I sat under a big tree, reading a book. The fresh air and #text(fill: red)[peaceful atmosphere] made me feel calm and healthy.

This trip to Beijing was #text(fill: red)[not only joyful but also meaningful]. I learned more about nature, Chinese culture, and #text(fill: red)[the importance of] spending time with family. #text(fill: red)[It was truly an experience I will treasure forever].

Thanks for listening!

*点评：*
- 语言表达比之前生动了很多，错句也少了很多
- 但还是有一些语法和拼写错误，慢慢积累和改正
- 书写还需要注意，尤其是字母大小写和标点符号
- 行文逻辑没有按照要求，这是硬伤！

Keeping fit is very important for everyone, #text(fill: red)[especially] for students. If we are healthy, we can study better and enjoy our life more.

There are many ways to keep fit. #text(fill: red)[Some] people often go to the gym on weekends. #text(fill: red)[Others] choose running, swimming, or playing ball games. Doing sports not only makes our body strong but also keeps our mind #text(fill: red)[active].

As for me, I often go skating with my friends once a week. My skateboard is really cool, and so are theirs. We try some new tricks together. #text(fill: red)[Although] some of them are #text(fill: red)[challenging], we always encourage one another. #text(fill: red)[Once you succeed], you will feel #text(fill: red)[a strong sense of achievement].

To sum up, keeping fit can make a big difference. It helps us stay healthy and build friendship. I believe everyone should find a sport they enjoy and keep doing it.

As for me, I usually go skating with my friends once a week. My skateboard is amazing, and theirs are cool too. We often try some new tricks. Although they are sometimes #text(fill: red)[quite] challenging, #text(fill: red)[we never give up]. #text(fill: red)[Instead], we encourage one another, and once we succeed, we #text(fill: red)[feel a strong sense of achievement]. From this experience, I #text(fill: red)[realized the importance of keeping fit and teamwork].

#text(fill: red)[To sum up], keeping fit #text(fill: red)[truly] makes a difference. It not only helps us stay healthy but also teaches us perseverance and cooperation. I believe that if we keep exercising, we will all benefit from it in the long run.
