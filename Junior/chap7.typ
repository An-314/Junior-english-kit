*A #text(fill: red)[Memorable] Trip to Beijing*

Dear teacher and classmates,

I am excited to share with you my #text(fill: red)[unforgettable] journey to Beijing during the summer vacation.

We set off by car, and #text(fill: red)[along the way] I #text(fill: red)[admired] the endless green trees and colorful flowers on both sides of the road. By the time we arrived, it was already evening. After #text(fill: red)[enjoying] a delicious hot pot, we #text(fill: red)[checked into] a comfortable hotel and#text(fill: red)[ prepared for the days ahead].

The next morning, #text(fill: red)[the golden sun rose over the city, filling the streets with warmth and energy]. We visited Beihai Park, where the lake #text(fill: red)[sparkled under the sunlight] and we took many beautiful photos. Later, we #text(fill: red)[tasted] the famous Beijing roast duck. Its crispy skin and tender meat #text(fill: red)[left a deep impression on me].

In the evening, we went to the park to relax. My parents jogged together #text(fill: red)[while] I sat under a big tree, reading a book. The fresh air and #text(fill: red)[peaceful atmosphere] made me feel calm and healthy.

This trip to Beijing was #text(fill: red)[not only joyful but also meaningful]. I learned more about nature, Chinese culture, and #text(fill: red)[the importance of] spending time with family. #text(fill: red)[It was truly an experience I will treasure forever].

Thanks for listening!
