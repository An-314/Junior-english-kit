*A #text(fill: red)[Memorable] Trip to Beijing*

Dear teacher and classmates,

I am excited to share with you my #text(fill: red)[unforgettable] journey to Beijing during the summer vacation.

We set off by car, and #text(fill: red)[along the way] I #text(fill: red)[admired] the endless green trees and colorful flowers on both sides of the road. By the time we arrived, it was already evening. After #text(fill: red)[enjoying] a delicious hot pot, we #text(fill: red)[checked into] a comfortable hotel and#text(fill: red)[ prepared for the days ahead].

The next morning, #text(fill: red)[the golden sun rose over the city, filling the streets with warmth and energy]. We visited Beihai Park, where the lake #text(fill: red)[sparkled under the sunlight] and we took many beautiful photos. Later, we #text(fill: red)[tasted] the famous Beijing roast duck. Its crispy skin and tender meat #text(fill: red)[left a deep impression on me].

In the evening, we went to the park to relax. My parents jogged together #text(fill: red)[while] I sat under a big tree, reading a book. The fresh air and #text(fill: red)[peaceful atmosphere] made me feel calm and healthy.

This trip to Beijing was #text(fill: red)[not only joyful but also meaningful]. I learned more about nature, Chinese culture, and #text(fill: red)[the importance of] spending time with family. #text(fill: red)[It was truly an experience I will treasure forever].

Thanks for listening!

Last summer holiday, I went to Dongbei Zoo with my family. The zoo was very big and beautiful, #text(fill: red)[with] green trees, colorful flowers and fresh grass everywhere. #text(fill: red)[Walking inside], I felt relaxed and excited. We saw many animals, #text(fill: red)[such as] bears, foxes and wolves. They looked strong and cool, and I #text(fill: red)[couldn't stop taking] photos. We also saw #text(fill: red)[various kinds of] birds, whose brightly colored feathers made the whole place more #text(fill: red)[lively].

#text(fill: red)[Among all the animals], tigers were my favorite. The tigers were large and strong. They had long tails and big paws, and on their foreheads there was the Chinese character “王”. It was really special and interesting to me.

#text(fill: red)[At the end of the trip], we enjoyed some delicious ice cream. #text(fill: red)[To sum up,] this trip left me happy and unforgettable memories. It not only brought me happiness but also made me realize the importance of protecting animals.
