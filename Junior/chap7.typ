*A #text(fill: red)[Memorable] Trip to Beijing*

Dear teacher and classmates,

I am excited to share with you my #text(fill: red)[unforgettable] journey to Beijing during the summer vacation.

We set off by car, and #text(fill: red)[along the way] I #text(fill: red)[admired] the endless green trees and colorful flowers on both sides of the road. By the time we arrived, it was already evening. After #text(fill: red)[enjoying] a delicious hot pot, we #text(fill: red)[checked into] a comfortable hotel and#text(fill: red)[ prepared for the days ahead].

The next morning, #text(fill: red)[the golden sun rose over the city, filling the streets with warmth and energy]. We visited Beihai Park, where the lake #text(fill: red)[sparkled under the sunlight] and we took many beautiful photos. Later, we #text(fill: red)[tasted] the famous Beijing roast duck. Its crispy skin and tender meat #text(fill: red)[left a deep impression on me].

In the evening, we went to the park to relax. My parents jogged together #text(fill: red)[while] I sat under a big tree, reading a book. The fresh air and #text(fill: red)[peaceful atmosphere] made me feel calm and healthy.

This trip to Beijing was #text(fill: red)[not only joyful but also meaningful]. I learned more about nature, Chinese culture, and #text(fill: red)[the importance of] spending time with family. #text(fill: red)[It was truly an experience I will treasure forever].

Thanks for listening!

*点评：*
- 语言表达比之前生动了很多，错句也少了很多

- 行文逻辑没有按照要求，这是硬伤！

修改一下：

My Trip to Lijiang

During the summer vacation, I traveled to Lijiang, Yunnan with my family by train. It was a sunny and *pleasant* day.

We first visited *several* ancient towns and *admired* the old buildings, which *were full of* history and *charm*. We tasted delicious local noodles and enjoyed *traditional* music that made me feel relaxed and happy. I also bought some small cups as *souvenirs* for my friends.

The next day, we climbed Yulong Mountain, *which* is about 5,600 meters high. When we *reached* the top, the view was amazing. We took many beautiful photos and enjoyed a hot pot meal there. The food was very tasty.

On the third day, we went back home. It was a wonderful trip, and I will never forget the landscapes and the joyful time I spent with my family.

这样也是一种表达方式：

During the summer vacation, I went to the Old Town of Lijiang in Yunnan with my family. It was a sunny and pleasant day, perfect for traveling.

In the morning, we walked around the old town. The ancient buildings were beautiful and full of history. We tasted the local rice noodles, which were very delicious. There was also some traditional music playing in the street, and I really enjoyed listening to it. It made me feel relaxed and happy.

In the afternoon, we went to Mount Yulong, which is about 5,600 meters high. The snow on the top of the mountain was shining under the sun. The air was fresh and cool. We took a lot of photos and had a great time there.

In the evening, we went back to our hotel. I felt tired but very happy. It was really a wonderful trip, and I will never forget the beauty of Lijiang.

再升级一下表达：

During this summer vacation, I had an *unforgettable* trip to the Old Town of Lijiang in Yunnan with my family. It was a bright and sunny day, and the sky was *as blue as* a piece of crystal. The *pleasant* weather made our journey *even more enjoyable*.

*As soon as* we arrived, I was amazed by the ancient buildings and the beautiful stone streets. Every corner of the old town *seemed* to tell a story from the past. We tasted the local rice noodles, *which* were soft, spicy, and full of flavor. *While* enjoying the meal, we listened to the traditional music, and the sound of the *instruments* made me feel peaceful and relaxed.

In the afternoon, we went to Mount Yulong, which *stands* proudly at about 5,600 meters high. The snow-covered peak looked like a shining diamond under the sunlight. *Climbing up the mountain was not easy, but the breathtaking view at the top was worth every step.* We took many photos and even had a small picnic there.

When we returned to our hotel in the evening, I felt tired but deeply *satisfied*. The trip not only *allowed* me to see the natural beauty of Yunnan but also helped me understand its rich culture. It was *truly* one of the most wonderful days in my life, and I will always *treasure* this memory.
