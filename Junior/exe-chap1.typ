  *短文填空题型解题方法与技巧*

  这种题目会给出一篇短文，文中留有若干空格，要求根据上下文和所给的词汇，选择合适的词填入空格中，完成短文。这些单词是可以发生曲折变化和派生的。
  - 在语法上，需要懂得每个词的词性和用法。
  - 以及其变换的方式
    - 动词：考虑时态和语态的变化
      - 时态：人称+时+态，语态：主动/被动
    - 名词：考虑数和格
      - 数：单数和复数，格：所有格
    - 代词：考虑人称/物主代词的变化，虑反身代词和指示代词的用法
    - 形容词：考虑比较级和最高级，以及其副词变化
    - 副词：考虑比较级和最高级
  + 通读全文，掌握大意
    - 先不要急着填空，要先把短文快速读一遍，理解文章的背景、时间、地点、人物和大概情节。
    - 把握故事线索（一般是：开头点题 → 中间活动/事件 → 结尾感受）。
    - 有了整体印象后，填空时才不会只盯着局部，而选错词。
  + 结合上下文，寻找语境提示
    - 前后句的逻辑很重要。比如：
      - “We were very #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%)) and began to make a preparation” → 前面提到打电话得知要来，心情应该是 excited。
      - “We didn’t want to get #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%)), so we went to watch a movie” → 雨天避免淋湿 → wet。
    - 多关注*转折词 (but, so, because, although)、情感词（happy, pleased, hungry）*等提示。
  + 注意词性与语法结构
    - 题目给的单词有 名词、动词、形容词、副词、代词，要根据语法来判断。
      - 动词原形：通常跟在主语后面 (We #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%))  to do sth.)。
      - 名词：可作主语、宾语或介词后面 (some #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%)) )。
      - 形容词/副词：修饰名词或动词 (feel #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%)) , do sth. #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%)) )。
      - 代词：替代前面提到的人或物 (put #box(width: 4em, line(length: 100%))  up)。
  + 留意固定搭配和常见短语
    - 这些题常考*固定表达*，例如：
      - hang up (the phone) → 挂电话
      - feel at home → 感觉像在家
      - enjoy ourselves → 玩得开心
      - put … up → 把某物挂起来
      - mean a lot → 很重要
    - 一旦识别出这些短语，答案就呼之欲出。
  + 关注逻辑与常识
    - 除了语法，还要结合生活经验：
      - 吃饭前会“hungry”，餐厅里要点“something”。
      - 出门遇雨会“wet”，看电影时要“quietly”。
    - 这类题往往 考察常识 + 英语习惯表达。
  + 排除法和词义对比
    - 有时几个词意思相近，要通过语境对比：
      - joy / happy / excited → excited 表示当下的激动，joy 表示一种感受。
      - add / put / hang → add 表示“添加”，put up/hang up 表示“挂”。
    - 不合逻辑、不合语法的排除掉。
  + 检查与通读
    - 填完后再 从头到尾朗读一遍，看看是否通顺自然。
    - 特别注意时态、主谓一致和代词指代是否合理。
