== 语序规则 Word Order

英语句法的一个核心特点就是*严格的语序*，通常采用 *S V O*（Subject–Verb–Object）模式。掌握语序规则，有助于正确表达逻辑关系和避免歧义。本章分五节讲解常见规则和变体。

=== 基本语序：S V O

1. *肯定陈述句*
  - 结构：*主语 Subject (S) + 谓语 Verb (V) + 宾语 Object (O)*
  - 例：
    - She (S) eats (V) apples (O).
    - The students (S) watched (V) a movie (O).

2. *带双宾语*
  - 结构：*S + V + 间接宾语 IO + 直接宾语 DO*
  - 或：*S + V + DO + to/for + IO*
  - 例：
    - I (S) gave (V) her (IO) a gift (DO).
    - I (S) gave (V) a gift (DO) to her (to + IO).

=== 否定与助动词位置

1. *一般否定*

  - 使用助动词 + *not* + 动词原形
    - 助动词： be, do, have
    - 助动词需要配合时态
  - 例：
    - She *is not* (isn’t) happy.
    - He *does not* (doesn’t) like (V) coffee.
    - They *have not* (haven’t) seen (V-en) the movie.
      - They have seen the movie.

  各个时态下的一般否定句
  #three-line-table[
    | Aspect \\ Time | 现在时（Present） | 过去时（Past） | 将来时（Future） | 过去将来 （Past Future） |
    | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---- |
    | 一般 \ （Simple）          | 一般现在时  \ don't/doesn't do    | 一般过去时 \ didn't do    | 一般将来时 \ won't do | 一般过去将来 \ wouldn’t do |
    | 进行  （Continuous）   | 现在进行时   \ be not(isn't, aren't, am not) doing    | 过去进行时 \ wasn't/weren't doing | 将来进行时 \ won't be doing | 过去将来进行时 \ wouldn't be doing |
    | 完成  \ （Perfect）      | 现在完成时   \ haven't/hasn't done    | 过去完成时 \ hadn't done    | 将来完成时 \ won't have done | 过去将来完成时 \ wouldn't have done |
    | 完成进行 （Perfect Continuous） | 现在完成进行时   \ haven't been doing | 过去完成进行时 \ hadn't been doing | 将来完成进行时 \ won't have been doing | 过去将来完成进行时 \ wouldn't have been doing |
  ]
  - 如果原本时态包含助动词，就否定第一个助动词，*否则（原本时态没有助动词）用do当助动词进行否定*

2. *情态动词否定*

  - 结构：*modal + not + bare infinitive*
  - 和助动词一致
  - 例：
    - You *must not* (mustn’t) smoke here.
    - She *cannot* (can’t) drive yet.

3. *否定副词 mid-position*

  - 否定副词例如 *never*, *rarely*, *hardly* 通常插在助动词与实义动词之间
  - 例：
    - He *has never* traveled abroad.
    - They *cannot usually* finish so quickly.

=== 疑问句与倒装

1. *一般疑问句*（Yes/No Questions）

  - 结构：*助动词/情态 + S + V-rest* ($<-$ S + V-rest)
  - 例：

    - *Do* you *like* pizza?
    - *Can* she *swim*?

2. *特殊疑问句*（Wh-Questions）

  - 结构：*Wh-word + 助动词/情态 + S + V-rest*
  - 例：

    - *What* did you *eat*?
    - *Where* can I *find* a bank?

3. *系动词倒装*

  - 系动词（be, seem, appear…）前置形成疑问 linking-V + S + P  $<-$ S + linking-V + P
  - 例：

    - *Is* she *happy*?
    - *Does* that *seem* right? （seem 用 do-support）

4. *部分倒装*（倒装以强调或条件状语）

  - 否定副词/状语置于句首，谓语助动词随后倒装
  - 例：

    - *Never have* I *seen* such beauty.
      - I have never seen such beauty.
    - *Only after* the rain *stopped* did we go out.
      - We go out only after the rain stopped.

  - 部分倒装就是 *只把助动词 / 情态动词 / 系动词提前* 到主语前，而谓语的实义动词保持在原位。
  - 对比：
    - *正常语序*：I have never been there.
    - *部分倒装*：Never *have I* been there.
  - 它不同于 *完全倒装*（如 *Here comes the bus.* → 谓语动词直接放到主语前）。

  1. 否定词/短语置于句首

    否定成分前移时，为了强调要倒装。

    - Never have I seen such a thing.
    - Under no circumstances should you be late.
    - On no account can we accept the offer.
    - Not until he spoke did I realize the truth.

  2. Only + 状语置于句首

    当 *only + 状语*（only then, only in this way, only after...）放在句首时，主句要倒装。

    - Only in this way can we succeed.
    - Only after the meeting did he realize the mistake.
    - Only then did I understand what he meant.

  3. Hardly, Scarcely, No sooner…than…

    这些连词结构常用于表示“刚…就…”，句子前半部分要倒装。

    - Hardly had I arrived when it started to rain.
    - No sooner had she sat down than the phone rang.
    - Scarcely had they finished when the teacher came in.

  4. So / Such … that…

    为了强调，so / such 放在句首时要倒装。

    - So loudly did he speak that everyone could hear.
    - Such was his anger that he couldn’t speak.

  5. 表频率或程度的副词置于句首

    如 *seldom, rarely, little* 等，带有否定或限制意味。

    - Seldom do we have the chance to hear such music.
    - Rarely have I seen him so happy.
    - Little did I know what was going to happen.

  6. 条件句中的虚拟倒装

    省略 *if* 时，句子需要倒装。

    - Had I known the truth, I would have told you. (= If I had known…)
    - Should you need any help, just call me. (= If you should need…)
    - Were I you, I wouldn’t do that. (= If I were you…)

  总结
  - *部分倒装 = 助动词 / 情态动词 / 系动词提前 + 主语 + 其他成分*
  - 常出现在 *否定副词、only短语、so/such、条件句省 if* 的场合。
  - 功能：*强调* 或 *保持句子平衡/正式感*。

5. *完全倒装*（Full Inversion）

  - 完全倒装就是 *整个谓语动词（包括实义动词）放在主语前*。
  - 对比：
    - *正常语序*：The bus comes here.
    - *完全倒装*：Here comes the bus.

    和 *部分倒装* 不同：部分倒装只把 *助动词/情态动词/系动词* 提前，而实义动词不动。


  + 表示地点 / 方位 / 方向的副词置于句首

    当地点、方位或运动方向的副词或介词短语放句首时，常用完全倒装，尤其是在文学或书面语中。

    - Here comes the bus.（公交车来了。）
    - There goes the bell.（铃响了。）
    - On the wall hung a picture.（墙上挂着一幅画。）
    - In the distance appeared a tall building.（远处出现了一栋高楼。）
    - 注意：主语如果是代词（he, she, it 等），一般不用倒装。
      - Here he comes.（不用 *Here comes he.*）


  + 表示“强调存在”的 there be 句型

    - There is a book on the desk.
    - There were many people at the meeting.

    这是英语最典型的完全倒装结构。

  + 为了保持句子平衡

    当主语部分很长时，把谓语提前更自然。

    - Seated at the table was a group of students who had just finished the exam.
    - Lying in the corner are several old bicycles.


  + 在某些固定句型中

    - So do I. / So does he.（我也是/他也是。）
    - Neither do I.（我也不。）

    这些也是完全倒装，因为谓语整个提前。

  #three-line-table[
    | 类型       | 倒装内容             | 例子                                  |
    | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
    | *部分倒装* | 只把助动词/情态动词/系动词提前 | Never *have I* seen such a thing. |
    | *完全倒装* | 整个谓语动词提前（实义动词在前） | On the hill *stood* a tall tower. |
  ]

  总结
  - *副词（here, there, in, on 等）+ 动作 → 完全倒装*
  - *there be → 固定完全倒装*
  - *主语太长 → 倒装更自然*
  - *So do I / Neither do I → 固定完全倒装*

=== 副词与状语位置

1. *句首状语*（Fronted Adverbials）

  - 时间/地点/原因状语可置于句首，语义强调
  - 例：

    - *In the morning*, I go jogging.
    - *Because it rained*, we stayed home.

2. *中部副词*（Mid-Position Adverbs）

  - 频率副词（always, often, usually）插在*助动词与实义动词之间*；若无助动词，则跟在be动词后
  - 例：

    - She *always* goes to school by bus.
    - He is *usually* late.

3. *句尾状语*（End-Position Adverbials）

  - 方式/地点状语等常放句尾
  - 例：

    - She read the letter *silently*.
    - They met *at the park*.

=== 复杂语序与强调结构

1. *强调结构（It-cleft / Wh-cleft）*

  - *It-cleft*：It is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who + 其他成分
    - *It was *John* who called.*
      - John called.
  - *What-cleft (pseudo-cleft)*：What + 从句 + be + 被强调部分 【主语从句】
    - *What I need *is* a break.*
  - *反转型(Reversed pseudo-cleft)*：被强调部分 + is/was + what 从句 【表语从句】
    - *A break* is what I need.

  #note[
    强调句（It-cleft）和定语从句结构很像，因为它里面也有 that/who，但二者不同：

    - 定语从句：修饰先行词，句子成分不变。
      - The man who called you is my friend.
    - 强调句：把某个成分提到 be 动词后，改变句子结构以突出强调。
      - It was the man who called you.
  ]

  #exercise[
    把普通句改为强调句：
    - I saw Mary in the library last night.（强调主语）
      - It was Mary who I saw in the library last night.
    - We will start the meeting at 3 p.m.（强调时间）
      - It is at 3 p.m. that we will start the meeting.
    - He left because he felt sick.（强调原因）
      - It was because he felt sick that he left.
    - They met in Paris in 2010.（强调地点）
      - It was in Paris in 2010 that they met.
    - The teacher praised Jack for his hard work.（强调宾语）
      - It was Jack who the teacher praised for his hard work.
  ]

2. *主题前置（Topicalization）*

  - 将信息焦点前置到句首，其实是把强调句的It is that省略
  - 例：
    - *This book*, I have read *twice*.
    - *That he left*, nobody knows *why*.

3. *比较结构（Comparatives）*

  - More/less + Adj/Adv + than
  - As + Adj/Adv + as
  - 例：
    - She is *taller than* her brother.
    - He runs *as fast as* I do.

=== 补充

1. *状语（副词短语、介词短语）的一般顺序：*
  - *方式（Manner） → 地点（Place） → 时间（Time）*
    - She sang *beautifully* (方式) *in the hall* (地点) *last night* (时间).
2. *形容词在名词前的顺序（多形容词并列修饰）：*
  - *限定词/数量 → 观点/评价 → 大小 → 年龄 → 形状 → 颜色 → 材质 → 名词*
    - *a* (数量) *small* (大小) *round* (形状) *blue* (颜色) *wooden* (材质) table
3. *分裂句（Cleft）与强调倒装的补充*
  - *There-cleft*（强调存在/数量）
    - *There are* three books *on the table*.
  - *So… that…* 省略结果中 that：
    - He’s *so* tall I can’t see his head.
4. *动词短语与“非谓语”顺序*
  - 不定式、分词作状语时，多置于句尾或前置强调：
    - *To be honest*, I don’t agree.
    - She left early, *feeling tired*.


#exercise[
  - 将下列词组按正确语序排列成句：
    1. (she / yesterday / a letter / wrote / quickly)

    3. (He / often / to the gym / goes / on Sundays)
    4. (the cake / delicious / was / so / that / everyone / ate it)
    5. (in the garden / are playing / children / the)
  - 在空白处填入适当的否定词或助动词，并保持中部副词位置正确（mid-position）：
    1. She *doesn't* (not) usually *go* (go) to bed late.
    2. We never (never) see (see) such a beautiful sunset.
    3. You must (must) not (not) smoke here.
