- *主句从句的时态*

  在*时间状语从句*中，虽然从句描述的是未来、现在或过去发生的动作，其*时态*的选择却遵循一定规律，以保证句意清晰而不重复。下面按主句时态和从句功能分类，详细说明可用的时态及其用法。
  - *主将从现（Future – Present）*
    - *用法场景*：主句表达将来意义（will / shall / be going to / can / may…），时间状语从句表示“将来某一时刻或某一动作发生时”，语法上不在从句里用将来时。
    - *时态形式*：

      - *主句*：will + 动词原形（或其他将来结构）
      - *从句*：一般现在时
    - *常见连词*：when, as soon as, once, before, after, until, till
    - *例句*：

      - I will call you *when I arrive*.
      - We’ll start *as soon as* she *gets* here.
      - *Before* you *leave*, don’t forget your keys.
  - *过去时态中的时间从句*
    - *用法场景*：主句和从句都在叙述过去发生的事情。
    - *时态形式*：
      - 如果从句先于主句发生，常在从句中用*过去完成时*，主句用*一般过去时*。
      - 如果动作同时发生，从句与主句都用一般过去时。
    - *例句*：
      - *By the time* we *arrived*, the party *had started*.
      (先是 party started → then we arrived)
      - He *called* me *after* I *got* home.
      (两个动作先后，用一般过去时)
      - *Once* she *had finished* her work, she *went* out.
  - *完成含义（Since 从句）*
    - *用法场景*：表示某动作/状态从过去某点开始，一直持续到现在。
    - *时态形式*：
      - *主句*：现在完成时（have/has + 过去分词）
      - *从句*：一般过去时
    - *例句*：
      - I *have known* her *since* we *met* at school.
      - *Since* he *moved* here, he *has made* many friends.

  - 强调倒装结构中的时态
    - *no sooner… than / scarcely… when* 结构，引导时间先行者，用于强调“刚……就……”
    - *时态形式*：倒装时，先行从句用*过去完成时*，主句用一般过去时。
    - *例句*：
      - *No sooner had* she *sat* down *than* the phone *rang*.
      - *Scarcely had* I *arrived* *when* it *started* to rain.
  - 省略主语与助动词的分词结构
    - 常用于 *after / before / once* 等后，简化从句
    - *形式*：动词的*完成式分词*或*现在分词*

      - *完成式分词*（having + 过去分词）相当于 “after + 过去完成时”
      - *现在分词*（动词-ing）相当于 “before + 一般现在/过去时”（具体依上下文）
    - *例句*：

      - *After finishing* her work, she left.
        - After she *had finished* her work, she left.
      - *Before leaving*, please turn off the lights.
        - *Before you leave*, please turn off the lights.
      - *Once having read* the instructions, he started the machine.
