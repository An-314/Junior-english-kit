== 连词 Conjunctions

*连词*（Conjunction）是用来连接词、短语、从句或句子的词，起到语法衔接和逻辑关系表达的作用。
在英语中，连词主要分为三大类：
- 并列连词（Coordinating Conjunctions）
- 从属连词（Subordinating Conjunctions）
- 关联连词（Correlative Conjunctions）

=== 并列连词 Coordinating Conjunctions

1. 常见的 7 个并列连词（口诀：FANBOYS）
  - For（因为）
  - And（并且）
  - Nor（也不）
  - But（但是）
  - Or（或者）
  - Yet（然而）
  - So（所以）

*用法特点*
- 连接的成分必须是相同语法地位（词 ↔ 词、短语 ↔ 短语、从句 ↔ 从句）
- 在并列句中通常用逗号隔开，尤其是长句或有两个主谓结构时
*例句*
- She is smart and hardworking.（形容词+形容词）
- I tried, but I failed.（句子+句子）
- You can go to the park, or stay at home.（句子+句子）

*要点：*
- *and 与 or 的逻辑*
  - and 表示并列，or 表示选择
  - 肯定句中用 and，否定句中用 or
    - I like apples and oranges.
    - I don’t like apples or oranges.
- *并列结构必须对称*
  - （错误）She likes singing and to dance.
  - She likes singing and dancing. / She likes to sing and to dance.

=== 从属连词 Subordinating Conjunctions

用来引导从句（状语从句 / 名词性从句），建立主从关系。详见这些从句的讲解。

常见类别及例词

  | 类别        | 常见连词                                                 | 示例                                                |
  | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
  | *时间*    | when, while, before, after, as soon as, since, until | I will call you *when* I arrive.                |
  | *条件*    | if, unless, as long as, provided that                | You can’t enter *unless* you have a ticket.     |
  | *原因*    | because, since, as, now that                         | He stayed at home *because* it was raining.     |
  | *目的*    | so that, in order that                               | She spoke loudly *so that* everyone could hear. |
  | *结果*    | so…that, such…that                                   | He ran *so fast that* I couldn’t catch him.     |
  | *让步*    | though, although, even though, even if, while        | *Although* it was raining, we went out.         |
  | *比较*    | than, as…as, the more…the more                       | She is taller *than* her brother.               |
  | *方式/地点* | as, where, wherever                                  | Go *where* you like.                            |
]

*要点：*
- *so / so that / so…that 区分*
  - so：所以（连词）
  - so that：以便（目的状语从句）
  - so…that：如此…以至于（结果状语从句）
- *从属连词引导的从句不能单独成句*
  - Because it was raining.（错误）
  - We stayed at home because it was raining.
- 英语的*从属连词（Subordinating Conjunction）*本身就已经表达了逻辑关系，不需要再在主句中加另一个表示相同关系的并列连词或副词。
  - Although / Though / Even though
    - 已经表示“虽然…但是…”，所以主句里不能再加 but。
    - Although it was raining, we went out.
    - （错误）Although it was raining, but we went out.
  - Because / Since / As
    - 已经表示“因为…所以…”，所以主句里不能再加 so。
    - Because he was ill, he stayed at home.
    - （错误）Because he was ill, so he stayed at home.
  - If / Unless（表示条件）
    - 已经包含条件逻辑，主句不再加 then。
    - If it rains tomorrow, we will stay at home.
    - （错误）If it rains tomorrow, then we will stay at home.

=== 关联连词 Correlative Conjunctions

成对出现的连词，用来连接并列成分，强调对等或对比。

  | ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | either…or         | 或者…或者… | *Either* you apologize *or* you will be punished. |
  | neither…nor       | 既不…也不… | She likes *neither* tea *nor* coffee.             |
  | both…and          | 既…又…   | He is *both* clever *and* hardworking.            |
  | not only…but also | 不仅…而且… | She is *not only* smart *but also* kind.          |
  | whether…or        | 是否…或者… | I don’t know *whether* he will come *or* not.     |
]

*要点：*
- *主谓一致*
  - Either…or / Neither…nor 连接两个主语时，谓语动词与靠近的那个主语一致。
    - Either you are wrong or I am wrong.
- *关联连词成对使用，不可漏掉一半*
  - （错误）Either you go, I go.
  - Either you go, or I go.
