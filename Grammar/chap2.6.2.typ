==== 语态 Voice

*语态*（Voice）是动词的一种语法范畴，用来表达主语与谓语动词动作之间的关系。

- *主动语态* Active Voice：主语是动作的执行者。
  - The teacher praised the student.（老师表扬了学生）
- *被动语态* Passive Voice：主语是动作的承受者。
  - The student was praised by the teacher.（学生被老师表扬）

===== 语态种类

- 主动语态 Active Voice
  - 结构：Subject + Verb + Object
    - She writes letters every day.

- 被动语态 Passive Voice
  - 结构：Subject + be + past participle (V-ed) + (by + agent)
    - Letters are written by her every day.

- 常见变体
  - get-passive（口语常用）
    - He got hurt in the game.
  - stative passive（状态被动）
    - The door is closed.（表示状态，不是动作）

===== 被动语态的构成规则

被动语态由 be 动词 + 动词过去分词（V-ed / 过去分词形式） 构成，be 动词根据时态、人称变化。

===== 被动语态的使用场景

- *动作执行者不重要或未知*
  - English is spoken all over the world.（英语在全世界使用）
- *突出动作承受者*
  - The new bridge was completed last year.
- *客观表达 / 科研写作*
  - The data was collected by researchers.

===== 主动变被动的转换

- 主动句的宾语变成被动句的主语
- 谓语动词变成 be + 过去分词，时态和人称一致
  - 主动句的主语用 by + 执行者（如不必要可省略）
    - 主动：Tom cleaned the room yesterday.
    - 被动：The room was cleaned (by Tom) yesterday.

===== 不能用被动语态的情况

- 不及物动词（如 happen, occur, arrive）不能直接变被动
- 表示状态的 have, belong to, cost, lack 等少用被动
